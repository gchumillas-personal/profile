        "text": "<p>For more than ten years I have been dedicated to the development of software and management applications. Although I started programming in <strong>Delphi</strong> and <strong>J2EE</strong>, I am currently focusing my attention on web-oriented technologies, such as <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>. Currently I develop applications in <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, an ideal combination to create user interfaces.
